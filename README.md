## üöß Development Status

> **Note**: This project is currently in an **early and active development phase**. While captn is functional and ready for testing, we're continuously improving and adding new features.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Docker Compose**: captn has been developed and tested exclusively with containers created via `docker run` commands. **Docker Compose support is currently untested** and may not work as expected. If you're using Docker Compose and encounter issues, please report them so we may improve compatibility if possible.

**We welcome testers and contributors!** If you'd like to help shape captn, we're especially looking for contributions in:

- **üìù Documentation** - Help improve guides, examples, and explanations
- **üß™ Testing** - Test captn in different environments and report issues
- **üèóÔ∏è Repository Optimization** - Create wiki pages, issue templates, and improve project structure

Your feedback and contributions are highly valued as we work towards a stable release!

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Create Directories

```bash
# Create directories for configuration and log files
mkdir -p ~/captn/{conf,logs}
```

### 2. Run captn Container

```bash
# Run captn container with proper volume mounts
docker run -d \
  --name captn \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -e TZ=Europe/Berlin \
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v ~/captn/conf:/app/conf \
  -v ~/captn/logs:/app/logs \
  captnio/captn:0.8.2
```

### 3. First Run (Dry-Run Mode)

By default, captn runs in normal mode but all containers are assigned to the `default` rule which **does not allow any updates at all** for safety reasons. To get a preview of what captn would do, you can:

  1. **Assign containers to different rules** in the configuration file
  2. **Run in dry-run mode** to see what would be updated:

      ```bash
      # Preview what would be updated
      docker exec captn captn --dry-run

      # Run actual updates (after reviewing dry-run results)
      docker exec captn captn
      ```

## üîß Advanced Features

### Pre/Post Scripts

captn supports executing custom scripts before and after updates:

- **Pre-scripts**: Run before container updates (backups, health checks)
- **Post-scripts**: Run after successful updates (verification, notifications, customizations, post-update or cleanup tasks)
- **Container-specific**: Scripts can be tailored to specific containers
- **Failure handling**: Configure whether to continue or skip/rollback on script failures

### Notifications

Get updates about captn's activities:

- Update status and results
- Error notifications
- Summary reports

#### Currently supported notification methods

- **Telegram**: Quick update summaries via Telegram Bot API
- **E-Mail**: SMTP-based email notifications with detailed HTML reports
